    <para id="para-00002">Data surrounds us. In business, there is always a need to better understand the company, the competitors, and the customers. You gain this understanding through data collection and data analysis. The field of statistics is centered on analyzing and making sense out of data. You may have taken a statistics class at some point, but even if you have not taken a statistics class, you have probably used some statistical concepts—maybe more often than you think. Concepts such as averages and probabilities are often applicable to everyday life. For example, you may have been exposed to some statistical concepts when learning about political candidates prior to an election. This could include the percentage of registered voters of a particular demographic or the correlation between geographic location and political party. Statistics can be applied across nearly all fields and situations, and there is almost always a need to know more and dig deeper into what the data are showing.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">There are two branches of statistics: descriptive and inferential. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Descriptive statistics</term>, as the name implies, describe situations. For example, the average transaction amount for purchases in a store at a specific location is descriptive information about that location. Another example of descriptive information is the turnover rate of employees in a manufacturing facility.</para>
    <para id="para-00004">Inferential statistics relate to predicting and forecasting. With <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">inferential statistics</term>, you are using historical data and trends to forecast future performance. The regional sales manager might use the last five years of sales data to make a forecast for this year’s total sales. A nonprofit organization might use historical fundraising efforts to make predictions about fundraising for the next two years. Both branches are useful in understanding data. Information garnered from statistics can be used in a variety of ways in businesses to improve performance and track progress. Microsoft Excel has a variety of tools to make statistical analysis easier.</para>

    <title>Basic Statistical Functions</title>
    <para id="para-00005">There are several commonly used <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">statistical functions</term> that can give you a basic summary and understanding of the information in your spreadsheet. You can access the functions through the Formulas tab. From this tab, you can either choose Insert Function on the far left of the tab or use the grouped functions in the Function Library (<link target-id="fig-00001"/>). The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">Function Library</term> is helpful if you are not quite sure of the appropriate function for your needs. The functions are organized by application (e.g., financial) and include the ones that are most commonly used.</para>

    <para id="para-00015">The CONCATENATE function is useful when data comes from a database or other files. It combines information from multiple columns into a single column. For example, data imported into an Excel spreadsheet often contains first and last names in separate columns. With the CONCATENATE function, you can easily combine those two columns into a single column. To use the function, select the text elements that you want to combine into one cell (<link target-id="fig-00009"/>). To include a space, in the Text2 argument insert “ ” (quotation marks with a space between). This will then output the first name last name correctly spaced. Use AutoFill to copy the CONCATENATE function through the entire list.

    <para id="para-00016">The Text to Columns tool on the Data tab is the opposite of the CONCATENATE function. It takes a single column of text and separates it into two or more columns. This tool is also a helpful tool if you are importing information. Sometimes data imported from another program might not be in the format you desire or need for further analysis. For example, you can use this tool to place First Name and Last Name in a separate column if they are imported into a single column. Text to Columns can also be used to separate out City, State, and Zip into columns.</para>

    <title>Built-in Data Analysis Tools</title>
    <para id="para-00021">The Data Analysis tool add-in offers a variety of statistical tools. You likely won’t use many of them unless you are doing in-depth statistical analysis. However, there are several that are quite helpful for evaluating most datasets. These tools are some of the more frequently used statistical analysis tools regardless of the industry or application. The functions and tools are listed in the Data Analysis library in alphabetical order. Detailed explanations of the context, analysis, and use of these statistical analysis tools is outside the scope of this text. Rather than focus on the statistics here, this section will walk through the steps involved in using each tool.</para>

    <title>Correlation</title>
    <para id="para-00022"><term id="term-00036">Correlation</term> is used to analyze the relationship between two variables. The function in Excel computes the correlation between two or more variables at one time. The output is in the form of a correlation matrix or grid that shows how the variables are connected to each other. The closer the correlation value is to either +1 or −1, the more strongly connected the variables are to each other. A value closer to zero is a sign that the two values are not strongly connected. A positive correlation indicates that the variables will move in the same direction. This means if one variable is higher, the other variable will also be higher, for instance, when a company’s increased sales also increase their overall company profit. A negative correlation value indicates that the data move in opposite directions, for example, if an increase in price decreases the quantity sold. Only numerical data can be analyzed using correlation. If you have categorical data that you are interested in analyzing, you will need to code it using numbers.</para>
    <para id="para-00023">To use the tool, go to the Data tab and select the Data Analysis tool and then Correlation. Then, select the data of interest and click OK (<link target-id="fig-00012"/>). Be sure to select Labels in First Row if your dataset contains column headings. It is generally good practice to include these in your analysis as it helps to identify the information and has a more professional look. If there are no headings, the output will list the data by column number. You can also select an area on the page to display the output or have the output on a new tab in the current worksheet or a new worksheet entirely. The output will be static. That means if you change any of the data points in the selection, the correlation will not be updated. You will need to run the Correlation tool again to update it based on new or different data.</para>
    <para id="para-00024">WorldCorp would like to investigate the relationship between the price of their products and the quantity sold. Management thinks that the items with the lower prices sell more. For this example, the selected range is the Quantity column and the Price column.

Often, this level of detail is not necessary, so you may need to clean the output by reducing the number of decimal points and changing the column widths. You might also consider additional formatting such as bolding certain numbers or filling cells with color. According to the output, the correlation between sales and price is not very strong. The value −0.092 is closer to zero than it is to one, which indicates that management’s suspicion that more products at the lower price range are sold is not correct.</para>

    <title>Histograms</title>
    <para id="para-00029">A <term id="term-00038">histogram</term> is a chart that displays the number of occurrences of data within a defined range. This is a convenient way to easily see the ranges of most of the data. It is not an in-depth statistical analysis of the data; instead, it provides a summary of the overall distribution of the data. Histograms can be used with data that is at least at the ordinal level of measurement. The histogram function can be accessed through the Data Analysis library. When selected, as with others in the analysis library, an input window will appear (<link target-id="fig-00016"/>). You will need to input some information such as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">input range</term> and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">bin range</term>.</para>

    <caption>The input range and the bin range are needed to construct a histogram of the data. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license, Used with permission from Microsoft)</caption>
    </figure>
    <para id="para-00030">The input range represents the data being divided into the various “bins,” or category ranges. These bins must be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. In other words, each data point needs to have only one bin into which it fits. This means the bin ranges must be set up to accommodate the maximum and minimum values. Excel will sort the data correctly into the bins. Other options for the Histogram tool are to include the cumulative percentage, output a sorted histogram, or have the output be in the form of a chart in addition to sorting the data into each of the bins.</para>
    <para id="para-00031">Let us look at the WorldCorp sales data again. To construct the histogram, establish the number of bins and the size of the bins you will be using. Be sure to include enough bins to show differences that may exist in the dataset but not so many that it is difficult to see trends or that several bins have no data in them. A general rule of thumb is to divide the range of the data (highest data point – lowest data point) by the width of the categories. For example, if the range is 800 and you want each category or bin to increase by 50, you will need approximately 16 bins. You can also determine the range of each bin by first determining how many bins you want. For your range of 800, if you want 20 bins, each bin will have a range of 40.</para>
    <para id="para-00032">The column of data you will use for the histogram is column E, Unit Price. When using the Descriptive Statistics tool, you determined that the minimum number is $7.64 and the maximum number is $14,353. The output also gave the range of the dataset, $14,345.36. If you divide the range by the number of desired bins, you get the approximate size of the bins you should use. In this example, let’s use 15 bins. That would be 14,345.36/15 or 95.62. You then use this as a basis to establish the bin range that you will use in the Histogram tool. You can use whole number categories to make the histogram easier to follow and look cleaner. You could set the first bin at $100 since the value calculated was almost $100 ($95.62). This means that all data up to, but not including $100 will be included in that bin. Each subsequent bin will increase by 100 until you reach 16 bins. You record these bins in the spreadsheet manually. Excel does not create the bins for you. These bins can be either on the dataset worksheet or a separate worksheet (<link target-id="fig-00017"/>a). You will use these cells as your bin range when creating the histogram.</para>

It is another type of hypothesis test that can be used for in-depth statistical analysis. Select F-Test: Two Sample for Variances from the Data Analysis tool library. As with the other functions, an input window will appear (<link target-id="fig-00024"/>). You will need to select the range of each variable separately. The ranges do not need to be the same size. Check the Labels box if you included the column headings. Click OK when you are ready to analyze the data.</para>

    <title>T-Tests</title>
    <para id="para-00051"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048">T-Tests</term> are also hypothesis tests. T-Tests are used when data does not follow the normal distribution (a concept in statistics), when the sample sizes are small (generally less than 30), or when you do not have a population standard deviation. It is often used in statistics to test for statistical differences between two groups of data. There are three t-Tests available in Excel. The input windows look the same, except for the title of the input window, so make sure you have selected the appropriate test. The first type, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">t-Test: Paired Two Sample for Means</term> is for dependent datasets, such as if you are determining the success of a coupon campaign. You could track sales for a group of customers before the coupon and then track the sales for the same group of customers after the coupon campaign. You can then use this test to determine if there is a statistical difference between the means of the two groups, or you can input a specific level for the difference in the Hypothesized Mean Difference input argument (<link target-id="fig-00025"/>). If there is no set difference level you are investigating, then type “0” in the Hypothesized Mean Difference box.</para>
    <figure id="fig-00025" class="scaled-down-30">
    <media alt="A window titled t-Test: Paired Two Sample for Means lists options for Input: Variable 1 Range: (blank window), Variable 2 Range: (blank window), and Hypothesized Mean Difference: (blank window).

    <para id="para-00052">The two remaining t-Tests in Excel are for analysis with independent datasets. The tests are <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variances</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Unequal Variances</term>. You could use the two-sample t-Test to determine if there is a difference between purchase amounts for males and females. You could also use the test to determine if sales have changed between last year and this year. The difference between the two tests is that one deals with equal variances, and the other deals with unequal variances. You will need to determine before selecting the test if the variances are nearly equal or not. You can determine if the variances of two datasets are equal by using the Descriptive Statistics tool discussed in <link target-id="sect-00008">Descriptive Statistics</link>. When you choose the appropriate function, an input window will appear (<link target-id="fig-00026"/>). As with the Paired test, you will need to select the two ranges of data and a Hypothesized Mean Difference. If there is no difference, then type “0” into the Hypothesized Mean Difference box.</para>

    <para id="para-00053">Using the WorldCorp data file with unit price, you can determine if there is a difference in the unit price between Home Stereo Systems and Computer Servers Accessories. The t-Test is appropriate for this analysis because the population standard deviation is not known. In other words, you do not know whether the data follows the normal distribution. Upon verification, you determine that the variances of the two groups are very different, so you should choose the t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Unequal Variances (<link target-id="fig-00027"/>).</para>

    </figure>
    <para id="para-00059">To use the tool, you need to determine the target cell for optimization and the criteria (maximum, minimum, or a specific value). Then, you add the various constraints to the dataset. You can add up to 100 constraints to the Solver tool. Solver will find a solution to meet the criteria for the target cell assuming there is a solution. You can apply the solution to your dataset by choosing “Keep Solver Solution” with the output. There are many applications in business for Solver. For example, you could use the tool to determine the optimal level needed to minimize costs or maximize revenues in a business. You can use it to find the optimal solution for allocations in a retirement fund to enable you to retire at your desired age. You can also use it to determine the conditions necessary to pay off a mortgage loan in half the time. Take a look at this Excel file for some great examples of Solver and applications of the tool to various problems (solvsamp.xls).</para>

    <title>Data Integrity</title>
    <para id="para-00060">There are many ways that information and data can be manipulated to tell a different story from what is factual or to influence your interpretation of the information to slant a certain way. Simple changes such as adjusting the scaling on a chart or adding formatting changes to numbers can alter the way people interpret the information. For instance, you may want to show a larger than actual impact. You might decide to use a baseline number other than zero along the <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>-axis to show a much larger trend in the data than what is real. Or, perhaps you can choose to emphasize information and impacts by using very small units of measure. With today’s endless access to data, the influence of the media, and the ever-present “fake news” online, it is important to be diligent about making sure that data is accurately reported, analyzed, and presented to the intended audience.</para>
